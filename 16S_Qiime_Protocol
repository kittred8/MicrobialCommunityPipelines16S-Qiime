#How to use MSU HPCC system for MiSeq analysis using FastQC, Trimmomatic, R, and Mothur

#Access MSU HPCC Server
ssh -X userid@hpcc.msu.edu

#Access a developer node from a gateway (CPU used for processing sequences, this is the processing power version)
ssh dev-intel07 (chose other nodes if you want more performance and processor cores (k20=20 cores)

#Access MSU HPCC Server
ssh -X userid@gateway.hpcc.msu.edu 

#Use Moba Xterm if you use the Windows OS, as it has a gui for file bi-directional 

#Make directories in Documents folder
cd Documents
mkdir fastq16S
cd fastq16S
mkdir QC
mkdir TrimFastq16S
cd TrimFastq16S
mkdir paired
mkdir unpaired
cd /mnt/home/userid/Documents/fastq16S

#Make sure to load files into the folder "/mnt/home/userid/Documents/fastq16S", using manual transfer with moba xterm, filezilla or 
#use automated file transfer with "wget"


#Load FastQC, this program is designed to assess base pair quality scores, kmer content, adapter content, gc content, etc of reads.
module load FastQC

#This creates two quality assessment files forward.html and forward.zip and does the same for the reverse. These files assess the quality of your reads.
#fastqc ./ can be run on forward and reverse reads of individual samples as well
fastqc *fastq
fastqc *fastq

#Move fastqc to the QC directory
mv *fastqc.zip /mnt/home/userid/Documents/fastq16S/QC
mv *fastqc.zip /mnt/home/userid/Documents/fastq16S/QC

#Next move into the QC folder and look at each of the fastqc files (this will create a GUI where you can look at the html or the content of the zip files)
cd
fastqc 

#move to the fastq16S directory:
cd /mnt/home/userid/Documents/fastq16S

#Your next step is to improve the quality of your samples using trimmomatic in a bash shell script.
#Make sure the 16S V9 primers (Adapter16S.fasta) are included in the fastq16S directory (this can be done using nano or Moba Xterm).
#Create a shell script called trimmomaticPE_QC.sh, this shell will be used to quality score (minimum 20 base Q-score accepted, and minimum read length of 125)
#The script also removes adapters, primer dimers, and flips reads to make sure they are able to be paired.
#To do this type the line nano trimmomaticPE_QC.sh and then input the following lines including, but ending with 'done':

nano trimmomatic.sh

!#/bin/bash

#which contains a list of the forward or reverse reads, but without the suffix "_L001_R1_001.fastq" or "_L001_R2_001.fastq". To do this, run the following code:

#To run trimmomatic execute the shell script trimmomaticPE_QC.sh and quality control your paired-end reads type:
#Keep track of the trimmomatic version used for manuscript purposes
#Also, for now you are going to have to manually remove the _L001_R1.fastq from each file in the "filelist_PE_QC.txt"
#In a newer version I will do this in the R code above.

#To run qiime.sh and complete the analysis of your sequences:

qsub qiime.sh

#In the above script: We tell QIIME to look for the input file  -i , "combined_seqs.fna".
#We chose the clustering method usearch61  -m 
#We specify that output files should go in a new folder, usearch61_openref/
#We tell the program to overwrite already-existing files in the folder if we are running this program more than once (-f)

#Other default parameters of interest:
#Singletons are removed from the OTU table (default flag --min_otu_size)
#Alignment is performed with PyNAST
#Taxonomy is assigned with uclust
#Default workflow values can be changed using a parameter file


#Lastly open the folder containing a lot of files:

cd usearch_openref

#In the usearch_openref folder there are many files, but the following files are the two most important:
#otu_table_mc2_w_tax_no_pynast_failures.biom
#rep_set.tre
#The "otu_table_mc2_w_tax_nopynast_failures.biom" is the biom file that contains an OTU table (counts of OTUS) and the associated taxonomy
#The "rep_set.tre" is a phylogenetic tree of the representative sequences in your dataset.
#To learn more about the files check out the "qiime.org" site and for downstream microbial analyses.
#I personally recommend utilizing "phyloseq" and "vegan" R packages to perform downstream analyses
